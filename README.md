# telegram-facebook-bot
A poorly coded spider for Facebook pages in Python. Loads content from FB, formats it and sends it to Telegram channels
This is probably against FB's ToS, although I'm working on implementing their API.
It's incomplete, supports text, link, videos, photos and gifs but no shares or other kinds of content and it's still buggy
