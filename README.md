# telegram-facebook-bot
A poorly coded spider for Facebook pages in Python. Loads content from FB, formats it and sends it to Telegram channels
This is probably aganist FB's ToS, although I'm working on implementing their API
It's incomplete, suuports text, link, videos, photos and gifs but no shares or other kindsw of contents, is still buggy
